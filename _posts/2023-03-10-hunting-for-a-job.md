This is my first post on this website, which I have built to be my personal website. A big reason
for which I have decided to build it is so that I may have a place to show off projects and my
experiences building them. It is to be decided if I will get around to projects I built in the past,
but I will certainly make an attempt to document projects I build in the future. 

There is merit to this, I believe, outside of self-promotion. I find myself consulting other
peoples' blog posts on things they've built when they are similar to what I am trying to accomplish.
It really never hurts to have more information out there if there is even a small chance it could
help a programmer get through a hurdle. 

My content will not be, however, solely focused on things I build. I will also try to write about
things that I think about that may or may not relate to software and technology, such as the
political atmosphere in my home country of Bolivia. Writing this, I realize that it may be
appropriate to write a mini-biography as one of these first posts, and this may be next one.
