This is my first post on this page, which is to be my personal website. A big reason for building it
is so that I may have a place to show off projects and my experiences building them. It is to be
decided if I will get around to documenting projects I've already built, but I will certainly make
an attempt to document projects I work on in the future. As the title suggests, I was inspired to
make this by my current lack of employment (and unrelenting boredom thereof).

There is merit to this, I believe, outside of self-promotion. I find myself consulting other
peoples' blog posts on things they've built when they're relevant to something I'm doing. It really
never hurts to have more information out there if there is even a small chance it could help a
programmer get through a technical hurdle.

A separate, more important reason for creating this site, is simply that I find that writing helps
me think and that I tend to write better when I have the expectation that someone else will be
reading my thoughts. This site may not ever get many views, but the illusion of readership is
present regardless given the openness of anything published to the internet.

My content will not be focused on things I build. I will write about things that may or may not
relate to software and technology, such as the political atmosphere in my home country of Bolivia.
Writing this, I realize that it may be appropriate to write a mini-biography as one of these first
posts, and this may be the next one.
