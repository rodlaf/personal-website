I have a [double barreled
name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-barrelled_name). Perhaps would not
have been my first choice but name-changing paperwork sounds painful.

If you want to "pick" a single last name, it should be Lafuente, not Mercado. I
realize this goes against the some of the meaning of *last* in *last name*, but
it is a pretty strong preference of mine.
