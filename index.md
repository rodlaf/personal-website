Hello! I'm Rodney. I've recently earned a Bachelor's from Harvard University, where I studied
Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I was born and raised in La Paz, Bolivia, while also
having grown up extensively in the American Midwest and South during separate periods in my life. 

I'm on a full-time job hunt in tech (I know) and I aspire to begin a PhD in machine learning within
the next three years or so. I'm interested in both the underlying science and undiscovered
commercial applications of neural networks.

I've previously interned in the cryptography division of Amazon Web Services, where I made changes
to a code signing API. More recently, in the Silver Lab at Harvard Medical School, I used ensemble
methods to count and measure molecular structures in cells.
