I went on a retreat, a few months ago, to a rural part of Massachusets with a group at my school
focused on AI safety. I had a lot of interesting conversations about the current state and future of
AI, AI safety, and computer science in general. One of my big takeaways was how much the field of
computer science as a whole is shifting in scientific paradigm as a result of advances in the
development of neural networks. This was an idea I heard and agreed immediately with, and that a lot
of people I spoke to also did, and despite that I have not heard it said much, outside of that
conference and some specific research papers written in the last year.

The title is provocative on purpose. I do not intend to say that Computer Science is now, in all
aspects, like Experimental Physics as a scientific discipline. My intent is to argue that the
methodology used in core aspects of Computer Science are now, in structure and form,
indistinguishable from methods of discovery that are used in the lab sciences, one of which is most
notably and primordially experimental physics. There are two main points to my argument. The first
is that the importance of academic research in neural networks relative to the rest of what can be
classified as computer science has skyrocketed. The meaning of importance, here, I use to refer to
the overall impact of research produced to the non-academic world, that is, the real world. I'll use
experimental physics in the Cold-War era as an analogy to modern research and development in neural
networks both because I think its appropriate and because its a titillating comparison.

The second point relates more directly to the title. That is, that scientific methodology in CS, and
particularly in AI/ML, is changing dramatically. **Scientific methodology in some aspects of CS,
namely the study of neural networks, no longer consists predominantly of the construction of ideas
from first-principles, but rather, from experiments and observations.** This is somewhat unforeseen.
This characterization of
research in this area will increase strongly and consistently.

In high school, I aspired to do CS because I imagined it wouldnâ€™t be like modern day physics when it
came to funding. This has changed Computer Science is now like Experimental Physics. 

Computer Science research in Artificial Intelligence will now require extreme sources of money

Research is like cooking. No construction from first principles but rather SGD on complex
contraptions built on intuition and flimsy assumptions. This approach is very fruitful 

Research papers will now have many more authors than they used to have

Research papers will start to come out of non-Academic institutions more than ever for the next 20
years, before universities begin to roll out enormous amounts of funding for such research
experiments 

Big Tech has the deepest pockets that are willing to be emptied for these pursuits
