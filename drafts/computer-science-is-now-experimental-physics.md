- Talk about Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project.

The title is provocative on purpose. I do not intend to say that Computer Science is now, in all
aspects, like Experimental Physics as a scientific discipline. My intention is to argue that a few
very core aspects of Computer Science are now, in structure and form, indistinguishable from methods
of discovery that are used in some of the lab sciences, one of which is most notably experimental
physics. 

There is two main points to my argument. The first is to highlight the importance of academic
research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) as a forerunner in the overall
composure of Computer Science (CS). That is to say, AI/ML is now, more than ever, a more important
field in CS. Importance, here, refers to overall impact of the research produced to the non-academic
world, that is, the real world. 

The second point relates more directly to the title. That is, that scientific methodology in CS, and
particularly in AI/ML, is changing dramatically. **Scientific methodology in CS does no longer
consist entirely of the construction of ideas from first-principles, but rather, from experiments
and observations.**
